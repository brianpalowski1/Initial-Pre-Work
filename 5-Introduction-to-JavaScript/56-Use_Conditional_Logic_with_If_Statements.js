 // This section went over  "conditional logic" and how to use an "if statement" which makes a decision in your code

 // Example
 function ourTrueOrFalse(isItTrue) {
   if (isItTrue) {
     return "Yes, it's true";
   }
   return "No, it's false";
 }

 // Setup
 function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {

   // Only change code below this line.

   if(wasThatTrue){
       return "Yes, that was true"
   }
   return "No, that was false"
   // Only change code above this line.

 }

 // Change this value to test
 trueOrFalse(true);
