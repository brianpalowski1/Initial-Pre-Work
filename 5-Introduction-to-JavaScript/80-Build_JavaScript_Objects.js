// In this section we went over objects and how they  similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "test",
  "legs": 1,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["test","test"]
};
