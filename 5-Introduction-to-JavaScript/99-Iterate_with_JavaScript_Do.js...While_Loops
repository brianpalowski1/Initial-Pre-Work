// do loops are another type of loop first it will "do" one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then it runs "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true


// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.
do{
myArray.push(i);
i++
}
while (i < 5) ;
